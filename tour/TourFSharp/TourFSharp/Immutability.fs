module Immutability

/// Binding a value to a name via 'let' makes it immutable.
///
/// The second line of code compiles, but 'number' from that point onward will
/// shadow the previous definition.
/// There is no way to access the previous definition of 'number' due to shadowing.
let number = 2

/// A mutable binding. This is required to be able to mutate the value of
/// 'otherNumber'.

// When mutating a value, use '<-' to assign a new value.
//
// Note that '=' is not the same as this. Outside binding values via 'let',
// '=' is used to test equality.
